# Code Cracker Site and docs

This is the github repo for the Code Cracker site project. If you are looking for the repo for Code Cracker itself, go to
[github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker](https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker).

To see this site live go to [code-cracker.github.io](http://code-cracker.github.io/).

## Collaborating on the site

This site is done with [Jekyll Boostrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com). Check their page on the tech. If you are on Windows
you may want to use [Portable Jekyll](https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll) to save you **a lot** of time.

We **need** help with docs. Just reach us and we will let you know how to help.

We don't use the Github wiki on the Code Cracker project site, so this is also de docs site.
