We were finally able to bring this site up. This is just the first step, more docs are coming.

Right now the site has almost the same content we had before on the readme page. But it will
evolve fast. Be sure to check out frequently and sign our feed ([atom](/atom.xml), [rss](/rss.xml)).

We also have our first diagnostic page up and are looking for comments. Check out
[CC0006](/diagnostics/CC0006.html) and also our [diagnostics](/diagnostics.html) page.
